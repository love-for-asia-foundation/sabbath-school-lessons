#### Powerhouse for God

_By Andrew McChesney, Adventist Mission_

An elderly man stopped in Delsie Knicely’s family-owned store in rural West Virginia with a request.

“I’d like to see you in church this Sabbath,” he said.

Knicely didn’t want to go. She had been raised in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and had attended Adventist schools. But she had left the church as an adult, gotten married, and opened a store selling farm produce, groceries, and chain saws.

Still, she didn’t want to flatly reject the man, Kester Erskine, whom she had known since childhood. Erskine used to drive to her parents’ farm every Sabbath and pack her and her 11 brothers and sisters into his car, including in the trunk, and take them to church.

Now Erskine was in the store waiting for an answer to his invitation.

“I don’t have proper clothes,” Knicely said.

Erskine returned the next week, and Knicely offered another excuse. 

“OK, I’ll go if I’m not sick,” she said.

That Friday, she was hospitalized with a serious blood clot. That scared her, and she resolved not to use health as an excuse to skip church.

Two weeks after the hospital stay, Erskine stopped by the store with a book, National Sunday Law, about how the Sabbath was changed to Sunday.

Knicely read the 94-page book by Adventist pastor A. Jan Marcussen that afternoon, marking the pages as she went along. She read the book again that evening and a third time the next day. She thought, I went to Adventist church school and academy, and I know all this. Why haven’t I been in church?

“I couldn’t think of a good reason,” Knicely told Adventist Mission. “So, I went to church and haven’t missed a Sabbath since then.”

Today, Knicely, a spry 63-year-old with a ready smile, is a powerhouse for God. She has led many evangelistic meetings, including a series during a statewide evangelistic campaign funded by a 2015 Thirteenth Sabbath Offering. She also has graded thousands of Bible correspondence studies, and many people have been baptized through her influence.

Knicely said God must have a sense of humor. Ever since she claimed not to have anything to wear to church, her wardrobe has been full.

“The Lord has seen fit that I have had plenty of decent clothes since that time,” she said.
