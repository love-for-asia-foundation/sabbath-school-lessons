### My Three Wishes

_By Lu Shen-Xiong_

A year after my baptism, I applied for a new job as a truck driver because of Sabbath conflicts at my previous workplace. 

During the job interview, I announced that I had three requests:

- No Sabbath work

- No pork in the company meal boxes

- A loan of 50,000 Taiwanese dollars

The boss was stunned by my boldness. But he said, “Go work today, and we’ll talk about this afterward.” He wanted to see how I would work.

After the workday finished, the boss called me over. 

“You can work Sunday instead of Sabbath, but why don’t you eat pork?” he asked. 

His company, like many companies in Taiwan, provided employees with daily meal boxes. “Pork is cheaper than chicken and beef, so why don’t you eat it?” he questioned.

“This is my religious belief,” I replied.

The boss thought for a moment.

“Fine,” he said. “I won’t give you pork to eat. But why the loan of 50,000 Taiwanese dollars?” 

I explained that I had been injured in a car accident recently and had no money after the hospital bills and the expense of buying a new car.

“If I give you 50,000, how will you pay it back?” he asked. “Will you give me 10,000 a month or maybe 20,000 per month?”

“No,” I said. “I’ll give you 1,000 a month.”

The boss couldn’t believe his ears. A monthly payment of 1,000 Taiwanese dollars meant it would take more than four years to return the loan. 

But something—or Someone—impressed the boss to give me a chance, and he agreed to this last request. 

Six months into the new job, the boss called me over. 

“I’m forgiving your debt because you are such a good worker,” he said.

Now I couldn’t believe my ears. Working for God is good! 

Before the job interview I had prayed to God, “I want to interview for this new job, but You know that I have these three wishes. Please intervene.” God answered my prayer. 

When we do gospel work, nothing can stand in our way.
