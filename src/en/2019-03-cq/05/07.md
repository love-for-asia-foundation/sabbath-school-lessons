**Exploration**: Isa. 42:1–7

**Conclude**

True religion is following after the heart of God. As a prophet of God, Isaiah’s message was all about calling God’s people to live a life that reflected the character of the One they claimed to obey. Amos, Ezekiel, Micah, and other prophets also shared a similar perspective on the compassionate nature of God, pointing out our responsibility to respond to the needs of those around us. The biblical narrative in both the Old and New Testaments brings our attention back, again and again, to the necessity of caring for society’s most vulnerable and defining passivity or indifference to their suffering as sin against God. Ultimately, as the passage in Isaiah 42 expresses clearly, relieving suffering is the very work of Christ and the work that He was commissioned to do while He was on earth. The question then remains: what are we willing to do in response to His example?

**Consider**

- Listening to the song “Beauty for Brokenness (God of the Poor),” by Graham Kendrick, in which the writer prays for the compassion and justice of God to become a personal reality in his own life.
- Volunteering for a local community welfare event such as a canned food drive or soup kitchen.
- Sponsoring a vulnerable child through an organization such as Child Impact (https://childimpact.org) or International Children’s Care (http://www.forhiskids.org).
- Watching the short film “Depraved Indifference” by Eric Ludy on YouTube.
- Taking part in a two-dollar challenge (http://twodollarchallenge.org) to discover what it’s like to live on two US dollars or less per day and raise donations for an organization of your choice at the same time.
- Writing about your own needs and difficulties. How has the church demonstrated Christ to you? How has it failed? In what ways can you learn from your experiences to help you offer compassion to others who are in need?
