**Exploration**: Prov. 19:17

**Conclude**

Indeed, Christ’s greatest sermon was the life He lived. His life was a personification of service, sacrifice, forgiving, healing, teaching, and caring. This was especially true for the poor, sick, deprived, oppressed, and needy around Him. Such a life is the golden standard for all Christians.

In a world that discriminates, exploits, and subjugates the disadvantaged, the sweet embrace of Jesus engulfs those who are marginalized and outcast. In Luke 4:18 Jesus said He was anointed by the Spirit to proclaim good news to the poor, to proclaim freedom for the prisoner, to give recovery of sight for the blind, and to set the oppressed free. Just like Mary Magdalene, the apostle Peter, the blind, the deaf, and the Jews who were blessed by Jesus, today as Christians we have a duty to share our gift of knowing Christ to those who are in spiritual need. This will enable those around us to experience Jesus’ embrace too. Let us follow in the footsteps of Christ, the epitome of service, salvation, and sacrifice.
