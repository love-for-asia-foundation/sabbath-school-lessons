#### No More Devil Stones: Part 1

Yerakayya and Chinnammi live in a small village in eastern India. Like most of the people in their village, they work as field laborers planting rice. For this backbreaking work the couple earns about 45 rupees (less than USD 1) a day. That’s enough to buy food, but little more.

Yerakayya is a leader in his village, and life wasn’t easy. One night demons began throwing large stones onto their tile roof. The stones awoke them and broke some tiles on their roof. Night after night the stones disturbed their sleep. The demons sat in a tree near the couple’s home, but Yerakayya didn’t dare cut the tree down, or the demons might try something worse.

The couple prayed at every temple in the area, offering gifts and sacrifices to the gods to make the devils stop, but nothing worked. They heard that in a distant village people could work magic to make the devils leave. They made the long trip to the village and paid money for the people to work their magic, but when they returned home they found more stones lying on the ground around their house. That night more stones fell on their roof. The disturbances went on for a year.

One day a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, S. S. Rao, visited their village. He found Yerakayya and introduced himself. Then Pastor Rao told Yerakayya that he had come to tell the people in this village about the living God, who loves them and wants to save them. Yerakayya sat on his porch listening. The pastor could tell that he had been drinking and wondered how much he understood. Finally, the pastor asked Yerakayya what he could do to help the villagers learn a better way of living.

Yerakayya looked the pastor in the face and shouted, “If your God is a true God, show me. Make the demons stop throwing stones at my house, and I will believe!”Yerakayya pointed to the pile of stones lying nearby and told the pastor his story.

The pastor listened and then said, “I’ll prove that my God is stronger than the devil. I’ll hold meetings in this village. If the devils throw stones during the meetings, I’ll pray that God will make them stop. If the devils stop throwing stones, then you’ll know that the God of heaven is the true and living God.” Yerakayya agreed.
