**Exploration**: Eph. 4:2

**Conclude**

As we have been studying family unity throughout the week, family unity is based on truth and love (cf. Exod. 20:12). Within the law, we see the importance of the child honoring the father and mother. It is one of the last six commandments that express our love for others. And the Word speaks of the law of God as truth in Psalm 119:151. Love and truth bring true success to family unity.

**Consider**

- Memorizing Matthew 22:37–39 and repeating it in your head.
- Sharing the present truth with your family members who are unfamiliar with it.
- Going on Facebook or any social media site that encourages family unity to see how you could help those around you.
- Printing tracts centered on family, love, and/or the law and distributing them to your friends or coworkers.
- Singing Scripture songs with your family as the Sabbath begins.
- Praying to ask God to give you a loving, powerful relationship with your family.
