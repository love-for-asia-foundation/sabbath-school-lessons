**Exploration**: Rom. 15:5

**Conclude**

As we look at the verses that we have studied this week, it is clear that God considered our humanity and understood that anger and conflict would be a part of it. Though conflict will come, He wants us to use conflict as a catalyst to build character. Though we are all unique, we can be united in overcoming conflict and have oneness in the purpose of treating each other kindly.

**Consider**

- Interviewing a couple that has been happily married for more than 20 years to find out how they deal with conflict and keep their marriage growing.
- Writing out your feelings if you get into a conflict or get angry this week. Take the time to understand why you feel the way you do.
- Journaling three Bible texts that you can memorize to help you not get lost in your emotions when conflict arises.
- Listening to a song that encourages you when you are feeling down.
- Praying and asking God to show you areas in your heart that are areas for growth.
- Extending a kind gesture to someone you have had a conflict with recently to show that resolution can be made even after mistakes are made.
