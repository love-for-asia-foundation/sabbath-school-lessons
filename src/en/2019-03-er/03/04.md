Look again at the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. Do you see something in both chapters that makes the fourth commandment different from all the other commandments? The fourth commandment is the longest commandment. Some of the other commandments are written in only three or four words. (In the Hebrew language, these commandments are written in only two words at most!) Why is the fourth commandment so long? Because it explains why we must keep the Sabbath holy. It shows us how to keep it holy too. It also tells us to remember the God we worship. 

`Read Exodus 20:8–11. What do these verses say about the servants, strangers, and also the animals? What important truths do these rules teach us?`

Do you see that the Sabbath talks about how God wants us to remember the people around us? The Sabbath command is special. It separates God’s people and makes them special too. It makes them different from all other people on the earth. The Sabbath asks us to think first about the members in our communities that people think are not very important. They are the people who need rest the most. Who does the Bible include in this group? The slaves and foreigners who live in our country. It also includes work animals.

God wants everyone to enjoy the Sabbath day. The Sabbath truth teaches us that we are all equal, or the same, in God’s eyes. God gave workers the Sabbath. He also gave it to slaves. The Sabbath reminds slaves that God made them and saves them too. God invites the slaves to celebrate this truth on the Sabbath. “ ‘Even your animals and the foreigners living in your cities must not work’ ” on the Sabbath (Exodus 20:10, ERV).

God asked the Israelites to think about things in new and surprising ways. They were slaves in Egypt. Now they lived in their own new land. God did not want them to become the same as the Egyptians. That is why God gave His people very clear laws for their new land. He also gave them (and us) the Sabbath. The Sabbath helps us remember in a powerful way that every human is equal in God’s eyes. No one is better than anyone else.
