What was one thing God gave Adam and Eve that He did not give to anything else on earth? God gave humans the freedom to choose good or evil. But plants, animals, and trees cannot choose between right and wrong the way humans can. God feels that the freedom to choose is very important. That is why He let humans choose to disobey Him. God took a very big risk when He gave us free choice. But God wants people to choose to obey Him. He does not want to force us to obey. Forced love will cause us to fear God, not to love Him. 

God made angels free to choose right or wrong too. One of the angels chose to do wrong. His name was Lucifer. After Lucifer sinned, his name was changed to Satan. This name shows us that Satan is God’s enemy. Satan wanted to destroy the good things God made on this earth. So, Satan used the snake to trick Eve. Satan led Eve to doubt the Word of God and His gifts to humans. Satan caused Eve to feel these things were not enough to make humans happy (Genesis 3:1–5). What was Satan’s biggest trick? He led humans to want more than God gave them. Satan also led Adam and Eve to doubt that God was good. Worse, Satan caused humans to depend on themselves, not God. 

Adam and Eve chose to sin. That choice broke their connection with God (Genesis 3:8–10). Then Adam and Eve knew they were not wearing any clothes. They felt afraid and embarrassed. Their marriage was broken in many ways too. Their connection with the rest of the earth was broken in awful ways too. 

`Read Genesis 3:16–19 and then answer the question. How did the connection between humans and nature change after sin?`

Sin changed everything. Life became a lot harder for Adam, Eve, and every living thing on earth. Sin is real. Sin breaks things. It hurts and destroys people and our friendships. Sin separates us from God. It wrecks our families. It also makes it hard for us to live on this earth. All the problems in our lives and on this earth show us that sin is awful. 

But God made the earth to be beautiful. In Genesis 3, God promises to make our earth and our lives new. While we wait for that to happen, God asks us to do something. He asks us to follow His first plan for this earth.
