### Learning Cycle 

#### STEP 1—Motivate 

**Spotlight on Scripture**: Leviticus 27:30 

**Key Concept for Spiritual Growth**: Being honest with God through the practice of tithing exhibits trust in Him and offers believers an unlimited opportunity for growing fellowship with God. 

**Just for Teachers**: Use the following biblical story to demonstrate how God blesses His children for returning a faithful tithe, even under the most difficult circumstances. 

Times were tough. She had nearly exhausted all her resources. As with other widows of the time, life was tenuous at best. Drought had engulfed the land so that even wives with husbands to provide for them and their families found making ends meet an almost unachievable challenge. Her cupboards were virtually bare, and there was just enough to prepare one final meal for her son and herself. The future was bleak indeed. 

Now the prophet Elijah enters the scene. He asks the widow for a favor—for a cup of water; but what he does next seems unusually callous. “Elijah said to her, ‘Do not fear; go and do as you have said, but make me a small cake from it first, and bring it to me; and afterward make some for yourself and your son’ ” (1 Kings 17:13, NKJV, emphasis supplied). The demand, however, comes with a promise: “Thus says the LORD God of Israel: ‘The bin of flour shall not be used up, nor shall the jar of oil run dry, until the day the LORD sends rain on the earth” (1 Kings 17:14, NKJV). The widow of Zarephath acted in faith and did as Elijah had instructed. God, in turn, honored her faith, making good on His promise to sustain her and her son. Jesus said, “ ‘Seek first the kingdom’ ” (Matt. 6:33, NKJV). Our study this week, likewise, calls us to seek God’s kingdom first by returning an honest tithe; but it couples that call with the divine promise that builds our faith. 

**Opening Discussion**: Invite a class member or two to share a contemporary faith-building story about people who thought that they were unable to return an honest tithe but, acting in faith, did so and were rewarded because of God’s faithfulness. 

#### STEP 2—Explore 

**Just for Teachers**: God’s faithfulness is never in doubt, but it is forever doubted. Is this an oxymoron? It must be said that for those who have chosen a life of faith, God’s faithfulness has stood the test of time. In generation after generation, God’s committed followers have found Him to be faithful. For them, God’s faithfulness is never in doubt. Even through unimaginable calamity, Job exclaimed, “ ‘Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him’ ” (Job 13:15, NKJV). 

God, however, is forever doubted, because with each succeeding generation, He must prove Himself anew. God is willing to do so. He even seems excited about the prospect, for Malachi writes, “ ‘Test me in this,’ ” says the Lord Almighty, “ ‘and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it’ ” (Mal. 3:10, NIV). And the psalmist proclaims, “Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him!” (Ps. 34:8, NKJV). God delights in demonstrating His trustworthiness to each generation. He calls each generation to reciprocate by returning an honest tithe. 

**Bible Commentary** 

**I. A Matter of Honesty** (Review Leviticus 27:30, Malachi 3:8–12, Luke 16:10, and Hebrews 7:2–10 with the class.) 

Scripture tells us that tithe is “ ‘holy to the Lord’ ” (Lev. 27:30, NKJV). The concept of holiness is rooted in the Hebrew word kadosh, which means “set apart.” In other words, certain things are separated or set apart from everyday common use for special or sacred purposes. That portion of income called tithe does not belong to the believer at all. By divine designation, that 10 percent is God’s from the start. We do not make it holy by giving it. It is holy—separated for God’s purposes— whether we return it or not. 

Suppose a pedestrian discovered an envelope on the street with USD 2,000 enclosed. Common decency says that the envelope belongs to someone else and that the money should be returned to the rightful owner. It is simply a matter of honesty. We would not state that the finder was giving anything to the owner, for the envelope was not rightfully his or hers to begin with. Regarding tithe, we are not giving God anything, for it rightfully belongs to Him already. We actually are returning that which belongs to Him as a matter of integrity. 

Malachi declares, “ ‘Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! 

But you say, “In what way have we robbed You?” In tithes and offerings’ ” 

(Mal. 3:8, NKJV). When we withhold from God what belongs to Him, we are robbing God. But we also are robbing ourselves of at least two things: (1) a faith-building opportunity, created as we trust God to bless the 90 percent we retain, and (2) a heavenly investment opportunity. Jesus said, “ ‘Don’t store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be’ ” (Matt. 6:19–21, NLT). 

**Consider This**: According to Malachi, what does it mean to rob God? What are some other areas in which Christians rob God of something that is rightfully His? 

**II. A Matter of Faith** (Review Genesis 22:1–12, 28:14–22, Luke 11:42, and Hebrews 12:2 with the class.) 

The word commonly translated as “faith” in the New Testament, pistis, is sometimes viewed from the perspective of faithfulness or from the standpoint of belief. The verb form, pisteuein, is usually translated as “believe.” Practically speaking, both belief (faith) and faithfulness are involved in the God-human relationship. Sometimes “belief ” is understood as assent to testimony, while “faith” is understood as assent to testimony united with trust. 

The following story illustrates the difference between belief and faith. A famous tightrope artist strung a line across Niagara Falls. A large crowd assembled to watch this unprecedented feat. The daredevil asked the crowd how many people believed that he could cross without falling. Many hands were raised. That was belief as assent to testimony. He then asked who was willing to let him carry them across. That would have been faith as assent united with trust! This latter illustration of trust is the only one that concerns us, as assent alone does not have redemptive implications. Scripture tells us that even devils believe and tremble (James 2:19). So faith, as belief in God and faithfulness, as a demonstration of that belief, might be viewed as two sides of the same coin. 

As was stated earlier, relationships are two-way streets. Can we trust God? Can God trust us? In tithing, God initiates the relationship by “taking a chance” on us. He provides the 100 percent, wondering if we can be trusted to return the tenth (tithe). By returning the tithe, we trust that we can live as well or better on the 90 percent in God’s care than we can on the 100 percent, striving alone. 

**Consider This**: What does the faith exercised in tithing teach us about the faith involved in salvation? 

#### STEP 3—Apply 

**Just for Teachers**: How much of the cross is in your pocketbook? Christians claim that salvation is through faith alone. Believers say that our efforts cannot improve or contribute to that salvation one iota. We must trust in God alone. That is the message of the cross. When it comes to finance, however, the message seems to change. It becomes: “God takes care of those who take care of themselves.” Many act as though their creed were to trust God some, but trust their pocketbooks more. 

**Thought/Application Questions** 

- How might our tithing habits relate to our real experience of salvation? 
- How can believers ensure that their expressions of faith are coupled with sacrificial action? 
- How might returning an honest tithe actually enhance one’s spiritual progress? 
- How might returning an honest tithe actually influence nonbelievers to investigate the story of Jesus? 
- How is returning tithe related to Christ’s call to “ ‘seek first the kingdom’ ” (Matt. 6:33, NKJV)? 

#### STEP 4—Create 

**Just for Teachers**: Tithing is a spiritual decision that involves honesty and faith. Hebrews 11 tells us that it is impossible to please God without faith. It would be hard to say that it is possible to please God without honesty, too. Encourage class members to experience both. 

**Activity**: 

For current tithers: Tithing can become a mere ritual. Are we asking God to multiply our blessings and really expecting Him to open heaven’s windows? Be bold. Ask God for something special that would bring honor to His name. 

For nontithers: Try tithing. Keep a notebook record of the blessings you receive and share it with others.
