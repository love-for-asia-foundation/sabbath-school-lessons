title:  The Meaning of the Seven Last Plagues

In order to understand the seven last plagues, we must consider how they compare to the plagues of the seven trumpets and the plagues sent against Egypt in Exodus 7-11 (The last only made evident the hardened heart of Pharaoh).

The plagues of the seven trumpets take place over the course of Christian history and while the gospel is being preached, and Jesus is still interceding in the Heavenly Sanctuary. Their purpose is to bring the enemies of God’s people to repentance.

The seven last plagues happen just before the second coming, after the ceasing of Christ’s intercession, and after the people have decided which side they will choose. These plagues are God’s righteous judgment and the lost will reap the consequences of their choices.

“They are not intended to bring anyone to repentance, because the opportunity for repentance has passed, the preaching of the gospel is concluded (Rev 14:14––20), the pre-Advent judgment is finished, and intercession in heaven is no longer available (15:8)” [1].
