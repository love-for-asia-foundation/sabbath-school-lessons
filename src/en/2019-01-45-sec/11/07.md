**The Drying Up of the Euphrates**
The capture of ancient Babylon by Cyrus the Great is the background for the sixth place scene. As in the case of ancient Babylon, so here the symbolic drying up of the Euphrates River results in the collapse of end time Babylon––the enemy of God and his people. This scene must be understood symbolically, because as stated earlier, the Euphrates in Revelation represents the world’s civil, secular, and political powers, giving their support to Babylon (Rev. 17:15). While Babylon has all the nations behind himself (18:3), those powers will eventually withdraw their support and turn against Babylon, causing its fall (17:15–17). This is how the Euphrates’s drying up should be understood.

**Additional Thoughts**
A question arises: Why do the civil, secular, and political world powers have a sudden change in attitude towards Babylon? Up to the fifth plague, the world’s people have focused their hope on Babylon for protection. As they experience the upheavals in nature, they hope that Babylon will protect them.  However as they observe the fifth plague striking the very seat of the beast’s authority, the disillusioned people realize the impotence of Babylon to protect them from the plagues’ effects (Rev. 16:10). Feeling deceived, and filled with hostility, they are united as they turn against Babylon and destroy it.
