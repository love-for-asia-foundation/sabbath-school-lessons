The Devil will be successful in deceiving people and gathering them to “Armageddon” which is Hebrew for “Megiddo” which is not a mountain but a fortress city known as the setting for many battles in Israel’s history.

Megiddo is an allusion to “Mount Carmel” that looked over this city. It was the site of the clash between Elijah, God’s true prophet, and the false prophets of Baal. This battle decided who was the “true God” deserving of worship.

Just as the false prophets of Baal were destroyed, the seven last plagues will also fall down on those who have sided with the dragon, the beast, and false prophet. However, before the final plagues fall, Satan will bring fire down as Elijah did to deceive the world into thinking it is the work of God.

The “battle of Armageddon” is not a military battle in the middle east but a spiritual battle similar to that of what happened on Mount Carmel on a worldwide scale with God triumphing over the forces of darkness.
