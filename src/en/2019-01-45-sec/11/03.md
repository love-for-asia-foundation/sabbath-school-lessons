The context and description of the intense physical pain inflicted by the first five plagues tells us that we should interpret them as literal occurrences (Rev 16:1-11).

The winds that were held back are now unleashed. The seven angels receive the order from inside the heavenly temple, where intercession was previously taking place, to pour out the plagues on those who sided with the counterfeit trinity (16:1). The prayers of the oppressed saints are finally answered (8:4).

These first five plagues strike humans and nature alike, but people do not turn towards God. Instead, they blaspheme him and remain loyal to the beast. The 5th plague strikes the throne of the beast itself, the one to whom Satan delegated his authority. This shows us that Satan and his allies cannot withstand the divine wrath.

Babylon is unable to protect the wicked people. They have set their hearts against God and there is no terror or suffering that will convert them. God reminds His people that He
will protect them as the world goes through these catastrophic events. (Rev 7:16).
