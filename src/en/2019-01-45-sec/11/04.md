In the Old Testament, the Euphrates river provided water for Assyria and Babylon, Israel’s enemies, and served as a separating boundary between them and Israel. These nations’ attacks against Israel were compared to the overflowing waters of the Euphrates (Isa 8:7-8).

Revelation 17:1 describes end-time Babylon sitting upon many waters, which represents the civil, secular, and political powers aligned with Babylon (Rev 17:15).

The drying up of the Euphrates in the sixth plague symbolizes these powers withdrawing their support and subsequent attack on Babylon, causing its downfall. Until the fifth plague, the world’s people looked to Babylon for protection. But now they notice that Babylon is powerless to defend them, so they turn against Babylon to destroy it (17:17).

Still, the people’s hearts remain hardened against God and become fertile soil to be used by Satan. This is a powerful reminder for us to place our trust in God alone, and not in humans and human institutions.
