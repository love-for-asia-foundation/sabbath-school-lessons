Before the great battle of Armageddon, the nations on earth will be angry and the“time will come for judging the dead (Rev. 11:18). Thus, the judgment (God’s wrath) will be carried out in the form of the seven last plagues upon the unrepentant.

However, the divine wrath won’t reach out “those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name” (Rev. 15:2). Just like in the times of Moses, God’s people will sing a song celebrating God’s victory over sin (Rev. 15:1).

These victorious saints will be protected from the seven last plagues. They will be transformed and clothed with immortality and they will join the resurrected at the Second Advent.
