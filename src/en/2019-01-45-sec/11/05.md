In the Old Testament imagery of the coming king of the east, Revelation 16:12 delivers a powerful promise of Jesus’ Return that provides deliverance for God’s End-Time people.

In this spiritual Armageddon, Christ and His heavenly entourage overwhelm Satan and his evil forces. This ensures deliverance for God’s End-Time people.

Revelation 16:13, 14 talks about the three unclean spirits, an unholy trinity united in the work of deception. They represent religious powers under the sway of Satan (Revelation 13:11, 12) identified as linked to paganism/spiritualism, and apostate Christianity both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.

In this final conflict, every person will have to choose their allegiances well. Will we fall for the lying wonders of the three unclean spirits (Revelation 13:13-17) or wait patiently for the coming of the true King of the East?
