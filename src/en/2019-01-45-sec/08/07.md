**Satan’s Attack on the Remnant**

Up until now, the dragon has not been able to destroy the woman; however, he does not give up. He regroups to “make war with the remnant of her offspring’s, the ones keeping the commandments of God and having the testimony of Jesus” (Rev. 12:17). In a nutshell, this passage gives us what comes next in the book. It serves as an introduction to Revelation 13, where Satan prepares for the final battle against God’s end-time people.

The only hope for God’s people is found in Christ. Because of what Jesus did on the Cross, God’s people will be able to overcome Satan by the Lamb’s blood and by their faithful witness for Christ and the gospel (Rev. 12:11). We are not to be afraid of the future, because Christ has promised to be with His people forever, even until the end of the age (Matt. 28:20)
