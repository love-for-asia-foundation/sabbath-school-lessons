A woman symbolizes God’s people. If she is chaste she represents His faithful believers, if she is a harlot than she represents apostate Christians. The woman in Revelation 12:1-5 is Israel waiting for the Messiah. 13-17 is the true church that gives birth to the remnant.

The woman is clothed with the sun, which is the glory of Christ’s character and the righteousness of God. The moon under her feet symbolizes the “lesser light”, which are the Old Testament promises foreshadowing Christ’s work.

The Dragon or serpent of old is Satan, the enemy of God’s people, who has been waiting to destroy Jesus since the prophecy was given in Gen. 3:15. The tail sweeping down a third of the stars represents his use of deception to deceive a third of the angels.

The Dragon can also be identified with Pagan Rome, an agent of Satan, who was used to make war against Christ and His people in the first centuries of the Christian era.
