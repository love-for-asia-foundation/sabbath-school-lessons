Since the dragon has not been able to destroy the woman, he turns to “make war with the remnant of her offspring” (Rev 12:17). The church, portrayed by the woman, is no longer faithful (Rev 17), so Satan goes after what is left of the true church—the remnant that remains faithful to Christ.

In the Bible, the “remnant” refers to a small group of God’s people who remain faithful while the majority has apostatized (1 Kings 19:18). God’s end-time remnant has two characteristics:  

1. First, they obey God and keep his commandments. The first four of the ten commandments, which are about worship, will be a central test of loyalty and obedience in the end-time conflict (cf. Rev 14:7).

2. Secondly, they have the “testimony of Jesus,” equated with the “spirit of prophecy” (Rev 19:10). God’s faithful people will have the prophetic gift in their midst to guide them through those hard times. Important to note is that the prophet’s role is to bear witness to Christ.
