After being cast out of heaven, Satan now turns against the church of Christ on earth. But just as God cared for Israel during her wilderness years (Deut 8:15-18), He now cares for the church in the wilderness for 1260 years (AD 538-1798).

During this time, the Antichrist power persecutes people who are faithful to biblical teachings and not to tradition. God’s faithful people in the Middle Ages found refuge in isolated places to escape persecution and the corrupt influences of the institutional church.

The water from the serpent’s mouth alludes to Satan’s deceptive words in Genesis 3. Here, Satan tries to destroy God’s people through false teachings and persecution.

However, just as the earth swallowed the Egyptians persecuting the Israelites (Exod 15:12), so the earth swallows the water and rescues the woman. The earth is new territory in North America that initially provides protection for the church at the end of the 1260 years.
