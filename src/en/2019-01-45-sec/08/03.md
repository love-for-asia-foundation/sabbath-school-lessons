A battle took place in heaven after the child (Christ) had been taken to heaven (Christ’s return to heaven). The combatants were Michael, referred to in Daniel as the “chief prince” (Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1), the archangel (Jude 9), and YHWH himself (Jos. 5:13-15), i.e. Christ. On the other side was the Dragon, explicitly identified as Satan, who loses badly.

What sparks the war? Until Christ’s victory on the Cross, Satan still had access to heaven (Job 1-3). With the unmasking at the Cross, Satan is no longer welcome and restricted to earth. Satan does not take this well.

On the positive side, Satan (lit. “accuser”) no longer has access to heaven to accuse and berate God’s people before the heavenly throne, as he did with Job. Furthermore, his defeat is assured; it is now simply a matter of time.

On the negative side, we’re stuck here with a cornered and angry Satan, so hang on. But fear not, the cavalry is coming!
