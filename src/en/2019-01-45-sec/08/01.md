Revelation 12-14 functions as the bridge between the historical and last-day portions of the book of Revelation, with the preceding chapters outlining the historical struggle of God’s people while the subsequent chapters shift attention towards the conflicts faced by God’s End Time people.

The major thrust of the passage is to outline the final crisis in the controversy between Christ and Satan.

As we read Revelation 12, don’t lose sight of hope. It is tempting, given the fierceness of the conflict outlined in Revelation 12, to become discouraged. But the passage anchors our faith in the assurance that no matter how fierce, Satan’s defeat is guaranteed, and God’s people will be victorious.

In particular, Revelation 12 reminds us that when faced with Satan’s incredible fury, God’s End Time people secure their hope in Jesus.
