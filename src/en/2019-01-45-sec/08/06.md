Historically, Satan uses coercion and persecution by external enemies to attack God’s people. He also convinces them to make small compromises of their faith.

In the end-time, Satan realizes he is running out of time, he adopts a new strategy and “wages war” against God’s end-time Remnant (Rev. 12:17) using deception, spiritualism, and demoniac miracles (Rev. 16:14)

The word “Deceive” is frequently used in Rev 12-20 to describe Satan’s end-time activities. He successfully deceives the world through a counterfeit of the true God, and his salvific activities.

The Dragon (Satan) “is the leader who delegates duties to the other two members of the triad”. He is the counterfeit of God the Father and his work”- says Ranko Stefanovic. The Sea Beast is the counterpart of Christ, imitating Jesus and his ministry. The earth beast is a counterfeit of the Holy Spirit and his work in the world (Rev 1:11-17). Those two powers will be destroyed at the Second Coming of Christ, and Satan will be destroyed after the Millennium.
