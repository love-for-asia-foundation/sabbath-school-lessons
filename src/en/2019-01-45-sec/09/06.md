1. Power. It is foundational hunger of the beast that opposes God. The Beast seeks power by the obligation of conscience on humans.

2. The Beast’s hunger for power is sought to be satisfied by obligating the conscience of men and that is shown by the bearing of a particular mark on humans.

3. This mark of forced compliance is represented by a mark on the forehead and hand that mimics the intention of God’s mark, expressed in His word. By contrast, God’s mark is a willful expression of devotion to Him who is actually powerful.  

4. The Mark of the Beast is manifested in a capstone representation as a replacement day that is contrary to God’s mark. That mark is traditionally identified in Adventism to be Christendom’s Sabbath (or Sunday) which stands in opposition to God’s mark.
