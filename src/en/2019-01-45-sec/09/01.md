Revelation 12 and 13 outline different earthly powers allied with Satan in opposition to God and His people. In Revelation 12, God’s people suffer under the tyranny of pagan Rome, as well as under the reign of papal Rome.

Revelation 13 uncovers an alliance formed between the dragon and two other beasts. All three beasts, inspired by Satan’s malicious hate of all things godly, unite in opposition to God and His people.

Prophecy functions so that we won’t be surprised when what has been prophesied, happens. Yet, our knowledge of the future is at its best only partial. In reality, sometimes only after the prophecy is fulfilled do we fully understand what was previously prophesied.

The prophecies tell us what, but we might not know how or when prophesied events will happen. Rather than engaging in constant speculation, we would do well to heed the practical implications of prophecy in helping us live lives prepared for when God breaks into History.
