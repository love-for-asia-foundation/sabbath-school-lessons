John sees a beast that comes out of the sea (many peoples), just like the beasts in Daniel 7 and their religio-political power.

The sea beast becomes a counterfeit to Jesus and His ministry.

1. Everything He did was from the authority of the Father (Rev. 2:27) - The sea beast does everything with the authority of the dragon (Rev. 13:2-4).

2. He showed what the Father is like (John 14:9) - The sea beast is almost a mirror version of the dragon with 7 heads and 10 horns (Rev 12:3, 13:1).

3. He was killed and was resurrected (Rev 13:8) - The sea beast is “killed” and is “resurrected” (Rev 13:3).

4. At His resurrection, He is worthy of worship and total authority (Matt. 28:18) - When the wound of the sea beast “heals” it is worshipped and claims universal authority.

5. He ministered for 3 and a half years (Luke 4:25, 13:7) - The sea beast speaks for 42 months (3 and a half years, Rev. 13:5).
