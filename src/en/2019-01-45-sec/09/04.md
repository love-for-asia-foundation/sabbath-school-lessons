The earth beast is portrayed as the counterfeit of the Holy Spirit and His work on earth (Rev 13:11-17). The Holy Spirit guides people to salvation, directs people to worship God, exercises the authority of Christ, and performs miracles and signs. The earth beast, on the other hand, deceives people, directs people to worship the sea beast, exercises its authority, and also performs signs and miracles.

This beast comes from the earth, which had saved the woman in Revelation 12:14-16. It represents a power that is friendly to the church. But it is a new player in the scene, arriving after the sea beast receives a deadly wound during the French Revolution. This description fits the Protestant United States.

Unlike the sea beast, the earth beast has a harmless, lamblike, Christlike appearance. But it is deceptive: as prophets are mouthpieces of God, so this earthly power is a mouthpiece of Satan, inducing people to worship the first beast.
