Revelation 13 draws heavily from the imagery of Daniel 7. The sea beast physically resembles the beasts in Daniel 7; it also acts like the little horn. Both speak boastfully against God and persecute God’s people.

42 months, 1,260 days, and a time, times, and half a time all describe the same prophetic time period of 1,260 years (538-1798) when papal power ruled a religio-political union.

The 42 months also have qualitative symbolism. Jesus’ ministry lasted three and a half years, culminating in His crucifixion by a religio-political union (Jews and Romans). Thus during the 42 months, Jesus’ followers walk in His footsteps as they bear faithful witness to Him (see John 15:20).

The deadly power wielded by the sea beast calls for “patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people” (Rev. 13:10). It may appear for a time that the beast has triumphed, but in the end, God and His people are victorious (see Dan. 7:26, 27).
