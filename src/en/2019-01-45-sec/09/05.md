The earth beast is an end-time power that appears to be Christlike. Revelation 13 describes this Satan-controlled worldly power disguised as a lamb. This will deceive many.

One of the wondrous activities performed by this Beast is fire coming down from heaven (Rev 13:13), which in the OT is a divine prerogative. In 1 Kings 18:38 God sent fire in acceptance to Elijah’s offering and worship.

“The ‘image to the beast’ represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas”. - Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 445.
It is possible that a form of extreme Christianity led by the United States of America will cause a repeat of the Middle Ages practices in imposing erroneous dogmas. How cautious should Adventists be with the realization that this power dresses like the lamb?
