title:  The Three Angels’ Messages

God sends a warning message through the 3 angels (“messengers” from the Greek angelos). These angels represent the people of God as the messengers of this urgent end time announcement.

The “everlasting gospel” includes the “good news” of salvation and the “hour of judgment.” They are two sides of the same coin. It is good news for those who accept it because they are saved, but it means judgment for those who reject it.

This message is urgent and crucial to be shared and it has to be heard by every “nation, tribe, language and people”. This means that while Satan is trying to deceive everyone, the Gospel is also reaching to all the world.

The message is urgent because it concerns the destiny of every person. As Adventists, we are called to reach the world as “messengers” to carry the “good news” of salvation (Mat. 24:14).
