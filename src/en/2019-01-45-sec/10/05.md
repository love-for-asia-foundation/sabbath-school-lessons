Historical Babylon was a power that opposed God and oppressed His people. It was characterized by arrogance and rebellion against God, even seeking to be equal to God (Gen 11:1-9; Isa 14:12-15; Dan 4:30).

End-time Babylon symbolizes the satanic trinity, who unites apostate religious powers in opposition to God and His people. Just as historical Babylon, it is arrogant and seeks to take God’s place.

End-time Babylon is pictured as a seductive prostitute (Rev 17) who seduces the nations into illicit relationships with her, thus establishing a union of religious and political powers. Together, they will deceive people to worship the beast and its image, controlling people’s consciences and conduct.

The second angel’s message assures God’s people that this wicked system will not last long. Just like historical Babylon, it will soon come to an end (Isa 21:9; Jer 51:8). The repetition of the word “fallen” emphasizes the certainty of its collapse, which will be portrayed in Revelation 18.
