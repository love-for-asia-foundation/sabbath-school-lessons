The message of the third angel presents the “wrath of God” as  “unmixed, undiluted wine” (Job 21:20; Ps 75:8; Isa 51:17-23), meaning the full execution of God’s judgment for those who denied His salvation. This is portrayed in the seven last plagues, God’s wrath poured out on those who worship the beast (Rev 15:1; 16:1, 19).

On the other hand, the faithful people God, who have patiently endured until the end of times are recognized for “keeping His commands and remaining faithful to Jesus” (Rev 14:12).

In the Old Testament, fire and brimstone are symbols of judgment (Gen 19:24; Isa 34:8-10), and they denote total destruction. As part of the salvation process, it is necessary to completely eliminate those who reject repentance and salvation.

The third angel’s message calls for the great responsibility to go “to every nation, tribe, language and people,” warning them of the consequences of sin and proclaiming that salvation is still obtainable and available to them.
