The three angel's messages conclude with a positive statement. It points the saint’s endurance; these saints are entrusted with preaching the end-time gospel message (Rev. 14:12). These are the same people spoken of in Revelation 12:17, who are the object of Satan’s furious rage and attack. They are characterized by their unswerving faithfulness to Christ and to keep God’s commandments. The word “here [is the perseverance of the saints]” shows that their endurance is primarily because of their faithful preaching of the end-time gospel which counters Satan’s deceptive activities.

   These saints are promised that, if they suffer physical hardship and persecution even to the point of death (cf. Rev. 12:11), they will receive rest. They will rest from their labors and their good works will follow them. This promise contrasts with the threat to those who worship the beast and receive the mark of the beast––they will never have rest (14:11). The eternal destiny of God’s people is secured with Christ, who promised to always be with them, until the very end of the age (Matt. 28:20).
