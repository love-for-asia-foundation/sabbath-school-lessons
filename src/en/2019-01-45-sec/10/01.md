Revelation 14 shows God introducing His remnant church as the ones who will stand up against those who have been marked by the beast. There is no middle ground. The two sides are clearer than ever and everyone has decided whom to worship.

The great proclamation of the gospel (“good news”) is necessary for everyone to hear and make a decision to side with one of the two groups. Unfortunately for the ones who hear it but do not accept it, it means “bad news” because judgment is coming.

God doesn't want anyone to perish (2 Pet. 3:9). That’s why He sends His urgent message in three equally important parts “to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (Rev. 14:6). God sends this message for everyone to hear so that all can decide for themselves.

We are called to impart this message to the world. Christ died for everyone and His salvation is attainable, but there are still many in the world who need to be reached with the good news of love and justice.
