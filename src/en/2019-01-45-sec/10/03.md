The first angel’s message highlights two paramount elements of our relationship with God. These two are considered part of our response to Him for who He is and what He has done.

To “fear God” and “give Him glory” cannot be separated. We acknowledge the Almighty God for who He is and fully surrender to His will (“fear God”). We also recognize Him by responding with love and obedience (“give Him glory”).

Judgment is part of the Gospel. The investigative part takes place before the Second coming. Its purpose is to decide who is in a right relationship with God and who is not. This pre-Advent judgment takes place while the end-time gospel is being preached.

It is important to remember that judgment means “good news” for God’s people, for it means salvation and vindication. Meanwhile, the three angels message is directed to those who have not yet accepted Jesus, giving them a chance to repent and worship the living God.
