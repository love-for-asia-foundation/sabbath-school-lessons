Worship is the heart and defining issue of the final crisis. What distinguishes God’s end-time people is their unwavering commitment to worship only God even when compelled by beastly powers (Rev 14:12)

Rooted in the first four principles of the Decalogue (Ex. 20:2-11), worship of the Creator remains the standard of loyalty in the last days ( Rev. 14:7).

We see an almost exact quotation from the Sabbath Commandment (Exod 20:11) in the cry of the First Angel (Rev 14:7). This presages the coming conflict. This final conflict centers around issues of allegiance to God expressed in worship.

Therefore, the Sabbath functions in the last days as a special sign of our relationship with our Creator while calling all nations to acknowledge His claims on their loyalty, allegiance, and worship (Exod 31:13; Ezek 20:12).
