#### Doctor Demands Abortion

_By ANDREW MCCHESNEY, Adventist Mission_

Dina, a 60-year-old grandmother living in the Soviet Union, prayed every morning, “Lord, send me someone who I can tell about You.”

One day, Dina noticed a pregnant woman as she waited at the bus stop in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. “Are you expecting?” she asked.

The woman, Lyuda Savostina, began to weep. She was expecting a son, but the physician had insisted that she have an abortion. “The doctor says that if I try to have this child, he will be stillborn, and I will die,” she said.

Dina comforted the woman and invited her to visit her house church on Sabbath. Lyuda had never attended church but agreed to go.

On Sabbath, Dina and Lyuda  joined 12 other church members listening  to Pastor Yakov Kulakov preach about God’s faithfulness. Afterward, Lyuda shared her dilemma with the pastor. He encouraged her to trust God, and he prayed for her.

On Monday, Lyuda told the doctor that she would keep the baby. “Have you gone mad?” the doctor said.

When he couldn’t sway Lyuda, he summoned her husband, Vladimir. Later at home, Vladimir scolded Lyuda. “Are you so selfish that you are willing to die and leave your daughter without a mother?” he said.

“I will keep this baby,” Lyuda replied. “I trust in God.”

“Who is this God that you are talking about?” he asked. “There is no God!”

The next Sabbath, Lyuda returned to church. And the next Sabbath. Soon she was baptized.

The doctor turned out to be wrong. The baby was born alive, and Lyuda did not die. Little Sergei, however, was sickly and suffered seizures.

One day, Sergei suffered a severe seizure. His breathing stopped for 10 seconds. Twenty seconds. His lips turned blue. Lyuda fell to her knees, crying, “Lord, You gave life to this boy; please don’t take it away!”

Her husband rushed into the room. “Come here and pray!” Lyuda told him. “We need your faith too!”

Vladimir sank to his knees. “Lord, I believe!” he cried. At that moment, the baby began to breathe.

The whole family became Adventists, and Sergei, now in his 40s, remains a faithful church member to this day, said Pastor Kulakov, 66, who retired after 41 years of ministry and lives in Podolsk, south of Moscow.

Why did this family become Adventist? The reason is that an elderly woman prayed every morning, “Lord, send someone who I can lead to You today,” said Pastor Kulakov, pictured left. “There is power in this prayer,” he said
