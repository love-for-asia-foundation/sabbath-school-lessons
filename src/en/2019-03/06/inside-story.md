#### Dreams of Jesus

_By ANDREW MCCHESNEY, Adventist Mission_

Susumu Kanai had his first vision of Jesus as he lay in bed at 5:00 a.m. in Osaka, Japan. He had spent some time contemplating life every morning for 12 years in his hometown of 2.6 million people, located 310 miles (500 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo. But this time, he was startled to see a bright light. In the light, he saw a back-lit figure with outstretched arms. Curious to know more, Susumu searched online and found a photo of the giant Christ the Redeemer statue with outstretched arms in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He concluded that perhaps he had seen Jesus.

A short time later, Susumu had a nighttime dream in which he was seated across from a Man at a table. The Man had His hands on the table and was surrounded by a bright rainbow. When he visited a barbershop several days later, Susumu realized that the Man in the dream was Jesus. Leafing through a book of famous paintings as he waited for a haircut, he saw Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper and recognized Jesus from the dream. The dreams and visions continued. Susumu had a dream that he and seven other men had been captured in a foreign country. He watched as the seven men were killed one by one. When his turn came to die, someone grabbed him from behind and whispered, “I’m of the Coptic religion. Come with me.”

Susumu woke at that moment. He looked up “Coptic” online and was astonished to find a Coptic church located only 35 miles (55 kilometers) away. For the first time he wondered whether he should go to church.

A few mornings later, Susumu had another vision. He saw the words “Gospel of Matthew” run across his mind’s eye from left to right, like a digital advertisement. He didn’t know what the words meant; so, he looked online and learned that Matthew was a book of the Bible. He immediately downloaded an audio version of Matthew and started listening in his car. At the same time, he asked his landlady, whom he knew was a Christian, where she worshiped. She brought him to the Osaka Center Seventh-day Adventist Church.

_Susumu, is among dozens of unsolicited guests who showed up at unprecedented evangelistic meetings at 161 sites across Japan in 2018. Church leaders have never seen anything like it in a country where Christians account for only 0.7 percent of the population. “The Holy Spirit is doing something extraordinary  in Japan, bringing people to the church and convicting them,” said Adventist Church president Ted N. C. Wilson, who met Susumu. “We need to pray for the latter rain of the Holy Spirit so countries like Japan and many others become completely inundated with the Advent message.”_
