#### Driving Passengers to Christ

_By ANDREW MCCHESNEY, Adventist Mission_

Byungeun Oh, a taxi driver in rural South Korea, had never led anyone to Christ after years in church, and he decided to change that.

Byungeun saw many repeat customers and began to build relationships. He collected passengers’ cell phone numbers and, with his wife, took them out to eat and visited them at home.

One Sabbath afternoon, Byungeun and his wife, Mihyun Yun, visited the home of a passenger named Mr. Choi. They chatted for a while, and Byungeun invited the man out to dinner. As they left the house, Mr. Choi pointed to a small church nearby and said he once had worshiped there.

Byungeun saw an opportunity to share his faith.

“We have a very beautiful church,” he said. “Would you like to visit it?” Mr. Choi agreed to visit the church in the town of Chuncheon.

Byungeun drove to a local restaurant. Its Adventist owner expressed delight that Mr. Choi planned to attend church and declared that the meal of buckwheat noodles was on the house. The kindness surprised Mr. Choi and strengthened his resolve to visit the church.

After that first Sabbath, Mr. Choi returned to the church every week and was baptized.

Byungeun had won his first soul for Christ, and he didn’t intend to stop. One day, he saw an elderly man emerge from a house as he drove past.

He had seen the man before and stopped to greet him. “I was about to call for a taxi,” the man said.

Byungeun quickly offered to take the man to his destination. As he drove, he learned that the man was named Mr. Park and decided to visit him at home that evening.

Byungeun and his wife showed up with several small gifts. Mr. Park ushered them into the living room and introduced them to his wife, Chunja An. Byungeun learned that the wife had a problem. She couldn’t attend Sunday services at her church because she worked six days a week, with only Saturdays off.

“We go to church on Saturday,” Byungeun said. “Why don’t you come with us?”

Soon she was baptized.

In two years, Byungeun, pictured left, has led three people to Christ. He is convinced that if he, a 58-year-old taxi driver, can do it, so can anyone.

“Reduce your work so you can do God’s work,” he said. “Simplify your life, and then fill it with the joy of meeting souls.”
