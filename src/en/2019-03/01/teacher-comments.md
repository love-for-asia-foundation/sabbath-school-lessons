#### Part I: Overview

Wonder and awe are essential to a full life. As we read the Creation account in Genesis, chapters 1 and 2, we get caught up in watching God speak the cosmos into existence. We then see Him focused on forming humankind with His own hands and making man and woman in His image. We stand in wonder and awe at the mystery of Creation. Like the psalmist we declare: “When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?” (Ps. 8:3, 4).

In this lesson, we marvel at the character of the Creator and appreciate His finished creation. Conversely, we weep at the results of our broken relationship with God and nature. This lesson challenges us to     be stewards of God’s handiwork as He calls us to an existence of love, compassion, and stewardship in this broken world.

**Teacher’s Aim**:

As you teach the lesson this week, explore how our focus on the wonder of God’s creation and our calling to care for His earth, and all that is therein, affects our attitudes and actions.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Illustration**: The following story has been attributed to Sir Isaac Newton. Newton had an atheist friend. Because the friend did not believe in God, he preferred the position that the universe just happened. One day when Newton’s friend was visiting him, Newton showed him a model of the solar system. The sun, planets, and moons were all in their proper place. The sizes of the planetary and lunar spheres were in proportion and revolved around the sun at their relative speeds. The atheist was impressed with the model. “It’s intriguing,” he said, “who made it?”

“Nobody,” said Newton, “It just happened.”

**Scripture**: Albert Einstein has often been thought to have mused that he “who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe,  is as good   as dead: his eyes are closed.” The glories of creation clearly indicate an Intelligent Maker: “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good” (Gen. 1:31).

Humankind is part of God’s perfect creation (Gen. 1:31). God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Gen. 1:26).

**Discuss in Class**: What does it mean to be made in God’s  image?  “When Adam came from the Creator’s hand, he bore, in his physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 15 (emphasis added).

God’s image in humanity also is reflected in Genesis 1:28: “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” God can create; He has given some of this ability to humankind.

**Discuss in Class**: How is God using you and your church to restore “the image of God” wholistically in broken people in the community around your church?

**Discuss in Class**: Really, how good is God’s “very good”? Give some examples.

Here is an example of how good “very good” is: “If Adam, at his creation, had not been endowed with twenty times as much vital force as men now have, the race, with their present habits of living in violation of natural law, would have become extinct.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, pp. 138, 139 (emphasis added).

We do not really know exactly what Ellen G. White meant when she referred to “vital force.” Some scientists have suggested that part of the answer could be found in the energy-producing organelle “powerhouses” in the cell structure of living creatures. These powerhouses are called the mitochondria. The more mitochondria in your body, the more energy you will have.

Research has shown that endurance athletes have more than two times (200 percent) as many of these mitochondria “powerhouses” as nonathletes. When energy was measured in these athletes, it was found that they had around 25 percent more energy.1

Adam had 20 times (2,000 percent) the vital force that people now have. If an increase in mitochondria is related to an increase in “vital force,” that could mean that Adam had 20 times (2,000 percent) more mitochondria than the average person today. Can you imagine what it would be like to be in Adam’s presence? You could likely feel the energy exuding from him!

Adam and Eve were not only endowed with great vital force, but we also learn that “as Adam came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of noble height, and of beautiful symmetry. He was more than twice as tall as men now living upon the earth, and was well proportioned.”—Ellen G. White, Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 34 (emphasis supplied).

When God says His creation is “very good,” it is very good!

**Discuss in Class**: What would it be like to be in Adam’s presence— someone with 20 times more vital force than we have now? What would it be like to walk with him?

**Discuss in Class**: Contrast the “very good” handiwork of God and humankind, made in His image, with an evolutionary perspective in which humankind is a product of time + matter + chance.

**Discuss in Class**: How does the evolutionary perspective affect the way in which we view people?

In our broken condition, we need “vision correction.” Such spiritual “eyeglasses” will enable us to see all people as human beings made in the image of God (Gen. 1:26, 27), even though we all are broken and some people may not look or act as you would wish. It is important to see people through eyes of love and respect—not necessarily as they are now but as they can be when God works in their lives to restore them.

“The Lord is disappointed when His people place a low estimate upon themselves. He desires His chosen heritage to value themselves according to the price He has placed upon them. God wanted them, else He would not have sent His Son on such an expensive errand to redeem them.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 668.

Discuss in Class: Why are all people valuable? What is the difference  between pride and self-worth in light of Creation and Redemption? How does the high value of every person affect your church’s ministry?

**Scripture**: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion [let them rule] . . . over all the earth” (Gen. 1:26). “And God blessed them, and God said unto them . . . have dominion over . . . every living thing that moveth upon the earth” (Gen. 1:28). “And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress [till] it and to keep [watch over] it” (Gen. 2:15).

Dominion or rulership over God’s creatures and the earth is part of being made in God’s  image. God owns (Ps. 24:1) and rules the earth,  and we are His managers—the stewards of His earth and of its creatures. Amazingly, the Ruler made humans corulers along with Him!

Each human is not only linked to each human; all creation is linked. God Himself is linked to His creatures. (See Acts 17:24–26.) Consider the similarities in Scripture between humans and animals, tying them closely together. Both humans and animals (texts refer to all living creatures unless otherwise noted):
Are created by God from the earth [land creatures (Gen. 1:24, 25; Gen. 2:19); humans (Gen. 2:7); birds (Gen. 2:19)].2
Have within them the breath of life (Gen. 2:7, Gen. 7:15).
Receive God’s blessing [aquatic creatures and winged birds; humans (Gen. 1:21, 22, 28) and divine affirmation [all living creatures (Gen. 1:31)].
Are originally given a vegetarian diet [humans (Gen. 1:29); animals on the earth; winged birds (Gen. 1:30)].
Are capable of killing [humans (Gen. 4:8); wild animals (Gen. 37:33; 2 Kings 2:23, 24; Dan. 6:24); domestic animals (Exod. 21:28–32)] reptiles (Num. 21:6).
Are included in God’s covenant (Gen. 9:12).
Are beneficiaries of Sabbath rest [humans; domestic animals (Exod.  20:10)].
Are set apart for the Lord, if firstborn male [humans; domestic animals (Exod. 13:12, Num. 3:13)].
Are told to be fruitful and multiply [aquatic creatures; winged birds (Gen. 1:22); humans (Gen. 1:28)].3

How  is  your  theology  linked  to  your  ecology?4   What  is  included  in  our stewardship of “all the earth”? How does your caring for the environment, all creation, and also being your “brother’s keeper” (Gen. 4:9) impact your lifestyle and ministry? Have class members share what they already are doing about these important truths.

#### Part III: Life Application

Remember that the purpose of a Sabbath School class is not merely to sit around and have a nice discussion about fascinating historical and theological issues. In this lesson, we have noted that sin broke the relationships that God originally had intended for us. But we still have a role to play as stewards of the goodness of creation and as caretakers of our fellow human beings. With that in mind:

1.	Observe and appreciate what is left of the “very good” in nature. This week, take a walk out in nature. Look around you and notice all the “good” that you see. Bring home a beautiful stone or shell, feather or leaf. Keep it as a reminder that we need to appreciate God’s creation more.

2.	The next time you or your church gets involved in serving the poor, ask yourself, “Is what we are doing causing them to become slaves to our generosity?” In other words, are you offering services that help move the poor from relief to individual development, helping them envision a better future, while nurturing within them a spirit of stewardship? Discuss your  answer  in light of this reflection: if we limit our outreach to giving out day-old bread and other food every Wednesday, and the same people come back, month after month, year after year, for 10 years, we as a church are failing to help the poor to move toward wholistic dominion over their lives and surroundings. Consider parallel ministries that provide skills such as budgeting, literacy, language, job skills, and so forth that will provide a horizon of possibilities for a better life.
