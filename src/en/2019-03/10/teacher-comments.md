#### Part I: Overview

God is proactive in His desire to draw people to Himself. He seeks to make disciples who, in turn, become channels of  service that  exhibit His grace to the world. This intention is made clear in Titus 2:11–14: “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness  and  worldly  lusts,  we  should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.”

In this lesson, we ponder the love of God on which the entire plan of redemption rests. We sense the compassion of Jesus for the brokenness of humanity around Him. Each of us is part of that brokenness. We recognize that when we confess our brokenness and repent, we will experience God’s grace. How we live our personal lives will then be changed. In response to God’s grace to us, we will be motivated, empowered, enabled by God to show, without condemnation, His self-sacrificing love and grace to other broken people. This love will be demonstrated when we live the everlasting gospel in word and deed in our interaction with all humanity, regardless of nationality, race, or background.

**Teacher’s Aim**:

Explore with your class a deeper understanding of these familiar, though life-changing and powerful, truths.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Scripture**: Bring to class a picture or model of the human body. Ask the class: What does it mean to be human?

Read Genesis 1:26. Review what it means to be made in God’s image (see lesson 1).

“When Adam came from the Creator’s hand, he bore, in his physical, mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 15. The image of God in man became marred by sin. Thus, the purpose of redemption is to restore in humanity God’s image.

Ever since sin started, and up to now, God’s people are called to graciously reveal Christ and the gospel by partnering with Him in restoring humanity physically, mentally, and spiritually. How is this divine-human collaboration for restoration manifested in the Seventh-day Adventist Church? Here is one example: the church operates almost 500 hospitals, sanitariums, clinics, and dispensaries, not including nursing homes, orphanages, etc. Over 8,539 Adventist schools, from primary to university level, impact communities worldwide.1  Additionally, churches also exist to aid in restoration of the whole being. However, “[t]oo many times the church has promoted very unbiblical concepts by assigning the physical restoration of people merely to health professions, the mental part to educators, while the pastors and evangelists are expected to deal with the restoration of the spiritual part of a person. This is a very convenient arrangement, but unbiblical because a person cannot be divided into these parts. A person is a whole human being.”2

If our churches do not fully proclaim “the gospel of Christ” (Rom. 15:19) in a wholistic manner—addressing the physical, mental, and spiritual (including social) dimensions of humankind—our presentation of the gospel will be deficient. Our mission is not about merely saving souls through proclamation of the gospel, but saving and serving people wholistically.

Draw three columns on a board, if available, entitled: physical, mental, spiritual. Ask your class to think of how your church is serving    your community locally in each of these three areas. List the ideas on   the board in the appropriate columns. Discuss where your church can improve.

**Illustration**: Graffiti scrawled in the New York subway says, “God is alive—He just doesn’t want to get involved.”3   Sometimes, in the midst of our painful experiences we might be tempted to wonder if God is interested in our despair and pain. Ask your class: Because God actually wants to be involved with each of us individually, and equally loves  everyone  in the whole world (John 3:16), in what ways do you see Him loving you and caring for your needs? How is He using you as a channel to show His love and care for others?

Think about this admonition for God’s people to get involved: “Unless there is practical self-sacrifice for the good of others, in the family circle, in the neighborhood, in the church, and wherever we may be, then whatever our profession, we are not Christians.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 504.

**Scripture**: Jesus’ disciples believed that Jesus, as Messiah, would free Israel from Roman oppression and bring judgment and condemnation to their enemies.

But in John 3:16, Jesus overturns this misguided thinking. He reveals God’s love for this broken world. God gave His unique Son that, whoever believes (has faith) in Him will not perish, but inherit eternity. Then, in verse 17, Jesus makes it clear that His purpose, during His first coming, was not to bring condemnation and judgment, but to bring salvation. Jesus had to come as Redeemer before He could come as a Judge.

Through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus would pay the penalty for our sins so that all humanity would have a choice between perishing and having eternal life. Given that choice, all humanity will then face Jesus at His second coming. Read 2 Thessalonians 1:6–8.

How can we by our words and deeds proclaim, in a balanced way, the truths connected with both Christ’s first and second comings?

**Scripture**: In Ephesians 2:1–11, God’s people are reminded that they were dead in transgressions and sins. But, because of His great love and grace, they are made alive with Christ and reconciled to Him. (See also 2 Cor. 5:17, 18.)

Notice the same message in Ezekiel 37:1–10. God calls for the dry bones of His broken people to take heed of the fact that He will revive them. In verse 6, we see that God chooses to do this work by placing tendons, flesh, and skin on the bones and breathing upon them to bring them to life. What spiritual lessons regarding revival can you draw from this revival process?

God’s grace, which brings new life to His broken people, is given for two purposes as described in Ephesians 2:7 and Ephesians 2:10.

Revival and salvation of ourselves is not enough. We are saved “to do good works.” Even though we are not saved by such good works (Eph. 2:9), we are saved for good works (Eph. 2:10). Doing good works should not be dismissed as a way  of avoiding the risks of legalism. Rather a  deep understanding of grace prompts us to good works in response and  in partnership with God. Everything we do must be seen through the Cross of Christ. We are not working toward salvation, but from salvation.

**Discuss**: How does your salvation change your community?

**Illustration**: The gospel is not only an “everlasting gospel” (Rev. 14:6) for all time, it is an “all-inclusive” gospel for all humanity (John 3:16). All those who accept Jesus are saved (see also John 1:12), and God keeps on loving all those who do not accept Him. Ask your class: What additional “all” verses can you find?

Remember the song many of us grew up with in Sabbath School: “Jesus loves me, this I know”? In light of our greater understanding       of the gospel, perhaps we need another verse: “Jesus loves them, this I know.” When we see God’s love encompassing others, even people we might find difficult to love, we gain a larger insight into the greatness of the love of God. The love Jesus has for all humanity calls for amending the lyrics, as such: “Jesus loves us, this I know.”

This inclusive mind-set also will likely prompt a revision of other songs that we might sing and apply to our lives, such as “I’m So Glad Jesus Lifted Me.” Invite the class to think of other gospel songs that could use some additional inclusivity verses. If appropriate, close the class period by singing together one of these “revised” songs.

**Scripture**: Read Paul’s words about reconciliation in 2 Corinthians 5:14–21 together in class:

“For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we  thus judge, that if  one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died  for them, and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away;  behold, all things are become new. And    all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ,   and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses  unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now  then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”

The gospel works to break down walls erected by social distinctions. It also serves to bring reconciliation, not just between God and humans but    in human-to-human relationships, as well. How does this teaching apply to us? What does Paul mean when he says “that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves”? What does it mean to be “ambassadors” for Christ? Why must we become new creatures first?

#### Part III: Life Application

Wholistic biblical justice is central to the gospel and to sharing it. Sharing the gospel can be done by enacting it and living out its implications, as truly as it is done by proclamation. This intention can be accomplished most effectively with all of Christ’s wholistic ministry method, which brings “true success.” (See Ellen G. White, The Minsitry of Healing, p. 143.) No matter what step we are taking in Christ’s method, we can call it “success.” Being a link in the chain is as important as being the last link.

**Discuss**: As we seek to help others, why is it important to provide opportunities to them to follow Jesus? Or is social ministry alone enough? Why, or why not? As you ponder your answers, consider the following thought: When people accept Jesus into their lives, He will impart to them the power to make and sustain positive life changes. In fact, the gospel awakens a powerful impulse within the converted heart toward social reform. But that impulse must flow forth from an authentic relationship with Christ Jesus, a relationship in which His love abides in us and we abide  in Him. United in this way, as the branch is to the Vine (John 15:5–7), our efforts to improve the lives of others and lead them to Jesus will bear much fruit. “The strongest argument in favor of the gospel is a loving and lovable Christian.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 100.

Ask class members to share experiences in which they directly introduced the people they served to Jesus. How should we treat people who, up to now, have not accepted Jesus? Why is it important to serve people anyway, just because they are in need?
